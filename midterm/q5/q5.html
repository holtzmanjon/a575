The basic idea was to caculate the the integral of the function<br>
y = x^3 + x^{2/3}<br>
This was done both numerically as well as analytically.
<p>
For the numerical integration, Simpson's rule was used:<br>
\int_a^b f(x) dx \approx {(b-a)\over 6} \left(y(a) + 4 y((a+b)/2) + y(b)\right)
<p>
For the analytical integration, the result is given by:<br>

\int_a^b f(x) dx = x^4/4 + 3/5 x^{5/3} |_a^b
<p>
The integral was computed between 0 and 10. The numerical integration was
about 0.02\% off from the analytical one.
<p>
I then proceded to split the Simpson's integration up into multiple steps, 
and calculated the fractional error as a function of the number of pieces.
The results are shown in the following figure:<br>

<p>
The following table shows the fractional error as a function of the number
of pieces:<br>
